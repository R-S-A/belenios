  (** This module implements a simple distributed key generation. Each
      share is a number modulo q, and the secret key is their sum. All
      shares are needed to decrypt, but the decryptions can be done in
      a distributed fashion. *)

  val prove : Z.t -> G.t trustee_public_key M.t
  (** [prove x] returns the public key associated to [x] and a zero-
      knowledge proof of its knowledge. *)

  val check : G.t trustee_public_key -> bool
  (** Check a public key and its proof. *)

  val combine : G.t trustee_public_key array -> G.t
  (** Combine all public key shares into an election public key. *)
